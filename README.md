# Radishes & Failures

This feature was designed as an addition to [Radish](https://radish.coop/en)'s website.
Its intention is to attract more young people to the platform. Students who have failed a class can claim a free meal from one of Radish's partners.
They submit a proof of a failed class, which is then checked with a word processing program, before a discount code is displayed.

As of now, only the front-end portion is functioning, and we hope to integrate it fully with other essential components.
Frameworks/languages used are React and Python (for image processing).

To run the app, install react-scripts to run on local machine.
